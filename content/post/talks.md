I figured it would be nice to have one canonical place for talks I have given
on containers, container security, Docker, Kubernetes, and Open Source. So here
it is...

## 2017

#### [Google Cloud Next - Build user trust: running containers securely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd4JU7qzYbE)

**Co-Speaker: Alex Mohr**

This talk covers all the ways you can secure your Kubernetes cluster using a
Certificate Authority, Authentication, Secrets and more. We  also describe and
demonstrate the ways you can use Seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux and cgroups to make
your application containers as secure as possible - so you can build organizational
and customer trust.

#### [CoreOS Fest - Container Linux on the Desktop!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gES4-X6y278)

This talk covers how to build a secure desktop OS with only containers and
CoreOS Container Linux. It also describes the benefits gained from using
Container Linux as a base OS and how to go about running it on the desktop.

#### [Kubecon - Dance Madly on the Lip of a Volcano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNjylW8FV9A)

**Co-Speaker: [Brandon Philips](https://twitter.com/BrandonPhilips)**

This talk covers how we designed an awesome security release process for
Kubernetes and all it’s sub-projects.

Open source projects strive to be transparent in everything they do, but when
it comes to fixing security patches they need to find the right balance of
“open” and “responsible.” This means vulnerabilities should be reported in
a safe way as well as patches tested and reviewed with a limited audience. The
companies that rely on Kubernetes should have time to patch their systems
before a public announcement.

Various sets of infrastructure and collaboration are needed to make this
a reality. The design we used could also be applied to other projects and even
internally in your company.

## 2016

#### [Container Summit - Building Containers in Pure Bash and C](https://containersummit.io/events/nyc-2016/videos/building-containers-in-pure-bash-and-c)

This talk demonstrates how to build containers from the Primitives in Linux
without using a container runtime. Learn about the objects that make up
containers themselves.

#### [Arrested DevOps - Exciting Topics like Containers & Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPs5U5hdciM)

[Ben Hughes](https://twitter.com/benjammingh) and I chat with

favorite topic, security.

#### [Github Universe - Blurry lines between individual contributor & corporate backers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Iem6JK6PtY)

When working on open source projects, your contributions and opinions on the
project and its motives are usually very personal. This talk
covers intricacies of "choosing your battles" and how personal passion for
a project might conflict with corporate motives.
